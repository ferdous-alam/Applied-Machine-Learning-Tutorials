# Applied ML tutorials
This is a library written for modular implementation of many state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. There is a collection of statistical machine learning algorithms along with modern deep learning algorithms and deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The later two are part of an ongoing research project and will be published along with an arxiv paper.
