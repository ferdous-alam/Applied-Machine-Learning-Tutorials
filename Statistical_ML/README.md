# Machine_learning_intro
This is a comprehensive introduction to different Machine Learning algorithms. The main focus was to clear the concepts with proper visualization. I personally find plots of different simulated datasets very convenient for the algorithms. Some of them are collection of different sources and I forgot the source name. But it's good to find them in one place. 
This is still a raw version and subjected to change.
